  {
    q: "What is the admissions deadline for 2026 cohorts?",
    a: "Cohorts fill on a rolling basis. Early applications are reviewed first and benefit from priority counseling slots. We recommend applying at least 3 weeks before your preferred start date. Check the program page for specific cohort start dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the eligibility criteria?",
    a: "Most programs are open to graduates and working professionals across disciplines. You don't need a technical background for most tracks — a counselor will assess your profile and recommend the best-fit program and learning path during the eligibility review.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do the programs cost and are there EMI options?",
    a: "Program fees range from ₹60,000 to ₹1,80,000 depending on the track and duration. We offer 0% interest EMI up to 18 months through partner NBFCs. Scholarships can reduce total fees by 20–50%. Your counselor will walk you through all options.",
  },
  {
    q: "What scholarships are available?",
    a: "We offer Merit Scholarships (top applicants), Women in Tech Scholarships, Early Bird discounts (apply 6+ weeks in advance), and Veteran Professional awards. Scholarship eligibility is assessed during the counseling session — no separate application needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does placement support work?",
    a: "Placement support begins in Month 2 and runs through 6 months post-graduation. It includes resume reviews, mock interviews with hiring managers, referrals to our 500+ hiring partners, and a dedicated placement manager for your batch. 95% of job-seeking graduates receive at least one offer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the refund and cancellation policy?",
    a: "If you withdraw within 7 days of enrollment and before attending any live sessions, you receive a full refund. After that, a prorated refund applies for the first 30 days. No refunds are issued after 30 days from enrollment. Detailed terms are shared during the enrollment step.",
